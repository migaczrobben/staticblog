# Static website generator intended for use in simple blogs or books

This program can be used to create a simple blog or electronic book to be published on a simple, static web server. It generates small, minimal HTML files from a text file containing "posts" with a date, author, title, and body. Its features are simple, but it provides ample options for customization.

Additional details are available inside the file "generate.lua," which is the main program used in the system.
